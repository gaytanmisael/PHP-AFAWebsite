                      <p>AFA is a World Class provider of preferred trend-setting consumer products manufactured with industry disrupting methods and materials; distributed through our standardized fulfillment stations strategically located within a close proximity to our customers.</p>
                      <p>Success is in the bag, literally! American Furniture Alliance began grass roots style with two guys and a dream back in 1987 under the name American Bean Bag Company. Entrepreneurs, John Widly and Mark Markos, grew the company from a street corner bean bag business in Southern California into a double digit multi-million dollar mattress and furniture manufacturing corporation that provides branded consumer home furnishing goods to its consumers around the world. Its products are sold primarily through mass merchandisers, membership clubs stores, high frequency stores, grocery stores, e-commerce, drug stores, and neighborhood stores that serve countless consumers in developing markets. It operates through the Home Furnishings, Children's Furniture, Health Care, Pet Care and Indoor-Outdoor Lifestyle Products segments.</p>
                      <p>The Company has gone through many growth periods and has changed its corporate identity to fit its position in the marketplace. The Original American Bean Bag Co. started an easy 1-2-3 step Bean Bag Factory program that experienced a cult-like frenzy that spread across North America. It became one their most popular brands and is widespread today. Research and Development was taken to the next level on the mattress and furniture front as well. The writing was on the wall for an adjustment to their Corporate name that soley represented beanbags to also include their expanded furniture and mattress product lines. Elite Products Inc. was born!</p>
